Designed and 3d printed a small and simple tool to make aligned and well spaces holes to plant onions in !
- The design is parametric so you can set the desired distance / size for the holes. 
- you can just set the right row distance by tightening the wheels( only one printed so far) at the desired distance
- no back breaking : the central part is mean to put a wooden /pvc/ whatever rod so you can just roll it on the floor without bending over
